# Python-Basics-for-DataScience-and-AI

In this repository are either self made notebooks or exported notebooks full of tips and shortcuts about using Python, and using Python for Data Science & AI.

These are from courses on Coursera from the IBM series, and are not a full list or all that you can learn from them, just what I think would be useful to me to reference.

Overall, the tips and shortcuts are from these specializations and certifications:
1. [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-data-science)
2. [AI Foundations for Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-foundations-for-everyone)
3. [Applied Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/applied-data-science)
4. [IBM Applied AI](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/applied-artifical-intelligence-ibm-watson-ai)
5. [IBM Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)


I do encourage you to take the full courses as well!
